                Bluey is an Australian preschool animated television series that premiered on ABC Kids on 1 October 2018. 
                The program was created by Joe Brumm and is produced by Queensland-based company Ludo Studio. It was commissioned 
                by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the British Broadcasting Corporation, with BBC Studios holding global 
                distribution and merchandising rights. The series made its premiere on Disney Junior in the United States and is 
                released internationally on Disney+. The show follows Bluey, an anthropomorphic six-year-old Blue Heeler puppy who 
                is characterised by her abundance of energy, imagination and curiosity of the world. The young dog lives with her 
                father, Bandit; mother, Chilli; and younger sister, Bingo, who regularly joins Bluey on adventures as the pair embark 
                on imaginative play together. Other characters featured each represent a different dog breed. Overarching themes include 
                the focus on family, growing up and Australian culture. The program was created and is produced in Queensland; its capital 
                city Brisbane inspires the show's setting. Bluey has received consistently high viewership in Australia on both broadcast 
                television and video on demand services. It has influenced the development of merchandise and a stage show featuring its 
                characters. The program has won two Logie Awards for Most Outstanding Children's Program as well as an International Emmy 
                Kids Award in 2019. It has been praised by television critics for depicting a modern everyday family life, constructive 
                parenting messages and the role of Bandit as a positive father figure.
